I have collected these problems from various sources, and claim that I have not formulated them on my own.

2. You are given a choice of three doors by an Angel. You can choose only one of the doors among the three. Out of these three doors, two contain nothing and one has a jackpot. After you choose one of the doors, the angel reveals one of the other two doors behind which there is nothing. The angel gives you an opportunity to change the door or you can stick with your chosen door. You donâ€™t know behind which door we have nothing. Should you switch?
